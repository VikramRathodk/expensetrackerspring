## 2. Critical Missing Features (Build These First)

### 2.1 Budgets — ✅ COMPLETE

> ✅ **Built** — Budgets table, budget check on expense creation, alert threshold notifications, @Scheduled period reset, soft delete, all 5 endpoints.

**Completed endpoints:**

| Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|
| `POST /api/budgets` | Create a new budget for a category or overall |
| `GET /api/budgets` | List all active budgets with spent/remaining amounts |
| `GET /api/budgets/{id}/status` | Real-time: `{ limit, spent, remaining, percentUsed }` |
| `PUT /api/budgets/{id}` | Update budget limit or threshold |
| `DELETE /api/budgets/{id}` | Soft-delete a budget |

---

### 2.2 Recurring Expenses — ✅ COMPLETE

> ✅ **Built** — recurring_expenses table, CRUD endpoints, @Scheduled daily job at 00:05, auto-creates Expense via ExpenseService (triggers budget check), advances nextDueDate, auto-deactivates when endDate is passed.

**Completed endpoints:**

| Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|
| `POST /api/recurring-expenses` | Create a recurring expense |
| `GET /api/recurring-expenses` | List all active recurring expenses |
| `GET /api/recurring-expenses/{id}` | Get a single recurring expense |
| `PUT /api/recurring-expenses/{id}` | Update a recurring expense |
| `DELETE /api/recurring-expenses/{id}` | Soft delete a recurring expense |

---

### 2.3 Notifications & Alerts — ✅ COMPLETE

> ✅ **Built** — `notifications` table (V8 migration), `NotificationService`, `NotificationController`, `NotificationType` enum. Automatically triggered by `BudgetService` and `RecurringExpenseService`. Audited on read/delete.

**DB Table (V8__create_notifications.sql)**

```sql
TABLE: notifications
  id          BIGSERIAL PK
  user_id     BIGINT NOT NULL
  title       VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL
  message     TEXT NOT NULL
  type        VARCHAR(50)   -- NotificationType enum value
  is_read     BOOLEAN DEFAULT false
  entity_type VARCHAR(50)   -- e.g. "Budget", "RecurringExpense"
  entity_id   BIGINT        -- PK of the related entity
  created_at  TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()

INDEXES:
  idx_notifications_user_id       ON notifications(user_id)
  idx_notifications_user_unread   ON notifications(user_id, is_read) WHERE is_read = false  -- partial
  idx_notifications_created_at    ON notifications(created_at DESC)
```

**NotificationType enum values**

| Type | Trigger | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| `BUDGET_ALERT` | Spending after a new expense reaches `alertThreshold` of a budget | Warning |
| `BUDGET_EXCEEDED` | Spending after a new expense meets or exceeds the full budget `amount` | Blocking |
| `RECURRING_EXPENSE_DUE` | Daily scheduler auto-processes a recurring expense at 00:05 | Informational |
| `SYSTEM` | Reserved for generic system-level messages | Varies |

**How notifications are triggered**

- `BudgetService.checkBudgetOnExpense()` — called from `ExpenseService.createExpense()` before saving. Fires `BUDGET_EXCEEDED` (blocks the expense) or `BUDGET_ALERT` (warning) for every applicable budget.
- `RecurringExpenseService.processSingleRecurringExpense()` — fires `RECURRING_EXPENSE_DUE` after advancing `nextDueDate`.
- All `notificationService.send()` calls are wrapped in try-catch — a notification failure never interrupts the primary operation.

**Completed endpoints**

| Endpoint | Auth | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/notifications` | Authenticated | All notifications, paginated, newest first |
| `GET /api/notifications/unread` | Authenticated | All unread notifications (not paginated) |
| `GET /api/notifications/unread/count` | Authenticated | Integer count for badge display |
| `PUT /api/notifications/{id}/read` | Authenticated | Mark one as read — audit logged as `NOTIFICATION_READ` |
| `PUT /api/notifications/read-all` | Authenticated | Mark all unread as read, returns count updated |
| `DELETE /api/notifications/{id}` | Authenticated | Permanently delete — audit logged as `NOTIFICATION_DELETED` |

---

### 2.4 Dashboard Summary Endpoint — ✅ COMPLETE

> ✅ **Built** — `DashboardService` aggregates six data points into a single response. `DashboardController` exposes `GET /api/dashboard`.

**Endpoint: `GET /api/dashboard`**

```json
{
  "thisMonthSummary": {
    "month": "March 2026",
    "totalSpent": 12500.00,
    "expenseCount": 14
  },
  "budgetOverview": {
    "totalBudgetLimit": 30000.00,
    "totalSpent": 12500.00,
    "totalRemaining": 17500.00,
    "overallUtilizationPercent": 41.67,
    "budgets": [ ...BudgetStatusResponse per active budget ]
  },
  "recentExpenses": [ ...last 5 expenses by createdAt DESC ],
  "upcomingRecurring": [ ...active recurring where nextDueDate <= today + 7 days ],
  "categoryBreakdown": [
    { "categoryId": 1, "categoryName": "Food", "totalAmount": 6500.0, "percentage": 52.0 }
  ],
  "unreadNotificationsCount": 3
}
```

**Dashboard field definitions**

| Field | Source | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `thisMonthSummary.totalSpent` | ExpenseRepository | Sum of expenses from 1st of current month to now |
| `thisMonthSummary.expenseCount` | ExpenseRepository | Count of expenses in current month |
| `budgetOverview.budgets` | BudgetService.getBudgetStatus() | Real-time status per active budget |
| `recentExpenses` | ExpenseRepository | Last 5 expenses, sorted by createdAt DESC |
| `upcomingRecurring` | RecurringExpenseRepository | Active entries with nextDueDate ≤ today + 7, sorted ASC |
| `categoryBreakdown` | Computed in-memory | This-month expenses grouped by category, sorted by totalAmount DESC |
| `unreadNotificationsCount` | NotificationRepository | COUNT WHERE is_read = false |

## 2.5 Bug Fixes Applied

### Duplicate @PreAuthorize on Controllers — ✅ FIXED

> **Problem:** Spring Security 7 enforces that only one `@PreAuthorize` annotation may exist on a method (including annotations inherited from the class level). `ReportController` and `UserCategoryController` both had `@IsAuthenticated` + `@IsSuperAdmin` stacked at class level, which each expand to a separate `@PreAuthorize`. This caused:
>
> `AnnotationConfigurationException: Please ensure there is one unique annotation of type [@PreAuthorize]`

**Root cause:** Both `@IsAuthenticated` (`isAuthenticated()`) and `@IsSuperAdmin` (`hasRole('SUPER_ADMIN')`) are meta-annotated with `@PreAuthorize`. Spring Security 7 finds two competing values and throws on the first request.

**Fix:** Removed the redundant `@IsAuthenticated` from both controllers. `@IsSuperAdmin` already implies authentication — a user cannot hold the SUPER_ADMIN role without being authenticated.

| Controller | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| `ReportController` | `@IsAuthenticated` + `@IsSuperAdmin` | `@IsSuperAdmin` only |
| `UserCategoryController` | `@IsAuthenticated` + `@IsSuperAdmin` | `@IsSuperAdmin` only |

> **Rule going forward:** Never stack two security annotations that both resolve to `@PreAuthorize` on the same class or method. Use the most restrictive annotation only.

---

## 3. Security Improvements

### 3.1 Refresh Token Flow — ⬜ DEFERRED

> ❌ **Current Problem**
>
> Right now, logout is cosmetic. The JWT token remains valid for 24 hours after logout. Anyone who intercepts the token can use it until it expires — you have no way to revoke it.

**Fix: Short-Lived Access Token + Refresh Token** *(deferred for later)*

| Component | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Access Token** | Reduce expiry to 15 minutes (not 24 hours) |
| **Refresh Token** | Long-lived (7–30 days), stored in `refresh_tokens` DB table |
| **On Logout** | Delete refresh token from DB + add access token to Redis blacklist |
| **Token Refresh** | `POST /api/auth/refresh` — validates refresh token, issues new access token |
| **JwtAuthFilter Update** | Check Redis blacklist before accepting any token |

---

### 3.2 Rate Limiting — ✅ COMPLETE

> ✅ **Built** — bucket4j in-memory rate limiter on `POST /api/auth/login`. Max 5 attempts per IP per minute. Returns HTTP 429 with `Retry-After` header.

---

### 3.3 Audit Logging — ✅ COMPLETE

> ✅ **Built** — `audit_logs` table (V6 migration), `AuditLogService`, `AuditLogController`, `AuditAction` enum. Wired into `ExpenseService`, `BudgetService`, `RecurringExpenseService`, and `AuthService`.

**DB Table (V6__create_audit_logs.sql)**

```sql
TABLE: audit_logs
  id          BIGSERIAL PK
  user_id     BIGINT NOT NULL
  action      VARCHAR(50)   -- AuditAction enum value
  entity_type VARCHAR(50)   -- "Expense" / "Budget" / "RecurringExpense" / "User"
  entity_id   BIGINT NULLABLE
  old_value   TEXT NULLABLE (JSON snapshot before change)
  new_value   TEXT NULLABLE (JSON snapshot after change)
  ip_address  VARCHAR(45) NULLABLE (null for scheduler-triggered actions)
  created_at  TIMESTAMP
```

**AuditAction enum values**

| Category | Actions |
|---|---|
| Expense | `EXPENSE_CREATED`, `EXPENSE_UPDATED`, `EXPENSE_DELETED`, `EXPENSE_AUTO_CREATED` |
| Budget | `BUDGET_CREATED`, `BUDGET_UPDATED`, `BUDGET_DELETED` |
| Recurring | `RECURRING_EXPENSE_CREATED`, `RECURRING_EXPENSE_UPDATED`, `RECURRING_EXPENSE_DELETED`, `RECURRING_EXPENSE_PROCESSED` |
| Category | `CATEGORY_CREATED`, `CATEGORY_UPDATED`, `CATEGORY_DELETED` |
| Auth | `USER_REGISTERED`, `USER_LOGIN`, `ROLE_ASSIGNED` |
| Notification | `NOTIFICATION_READ`, `NOTIFICATION_DELETED` |
| Reports | `REPORT_EXPORTED` |
| Tags | `TAG_CREATED`, `TAG_UPDATED`, `TAG_DELETED` |
| Currency | `EXCHANGE_RATE_SYNCED`, `USER_CURRENCY_UPDATED` |

**Completed endpoints**

| Endpoint | Auth | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/audit-logs` | ADMIN | All logs, paginated |
| `GET /api/audit-logs/me` | Authenticated | Current user's own audit trail |
| `GET /api/audit-logs/user/{userId}` | SUPER_ADMIN | Any user's audit trail |
| `GET /api/audit-logs/entity/{entityType}/{entityId}` | ADMIN | Full change history for one entity |
| `GET /api/audit-logs/action/{action}` | ADMIN | Logs filtered by action type |

**Design notes**
- Audit failure never crashes the main operation — `AuditLogService.log()` catches and logs all exceptions.
- `AuditLogService.log()` is annotated `@Transactional(propagation = REQUIRES_NEW)` — it always runs in its own separate transaction, so a read-only or rolled-back caller transaction never blocks the audit write.
- IP address uses `X-Forwarded-For` header (proxy-aware); falls back to `remoteAddr`; stored as `null` for scheduler context.
- `old_value` / `new_value` are JSON strings serialized via `tools.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper` (Jackson 3.x — Spring Boot 4.0 package, NOT `com.fasterxml.jackson`).

## 4. Data Integrity Fixes

### 4.1 Schema Management — ✅ COMPLETE

> ✅ **Built** — Flyway enabled with `baseline-on-migrate=true`. Base profile uses `ddl-auto=update`; dev and prod profiles use `ddl-auto=validate`. Migration files live in `src/main/resources/db/migration/`:
> - `V1__create_roles_and_users.sql` — `roles`, `users`, `user_roles` join table
> - `V2__create_categories.sql` — `categories` with `UNIQUE(name, user_id)` constraint
> - `V3__create_expenses.sql` — `expenses` + indexes on `user_id`, `category_id`, `created_at`
> - `V4__create_budgets.sql` — `budgets` + indexes on `user_id`, `is_active`
> - `V5__create_recurring_expenses.sql` — `recurring_expenses` + indexes on `user_id`, `next_due_date`, `is_active`
> - `V6__create_audit_logs.sql` — `audit_logs` + 4 indexes
> - `V7__ensure_audit_logs.sql` — idempotent `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` guard for `audit_logs`
> - `V8__create_notifications.sql` — `notifications` + 3 indexes (including partial index on unread rows)
> - `V9__create_tags.sql` — `tags` (unique per user) + `expense_tags` join table + 3 indexes
> - `V10__add_currency_to_expenses.sql` — `currency VARCHAR(3)` + `amount_in_base DOUBLE` on `expenses`, backfills existing rows
> - `V11__add_base_currency_to_users.sql` — `base_currency VARCHAR(3) DEFAULT 'INR'` on `users`
> - `V12__create_exchange_rates.sql` — `exchange_rates` table with USD-pivot rate pairs + 3 indexes

---

### 4.2 Soft Deletes — ✅ COMPLETE

> ✅ **Built** — `deleted_at` added to `expenses`, `budgets`, `recurring_expenses`, `categories`. All queries filter by `deletedAt IS NULL`.

---

### 4.3 DB Indexes — ✅ COMPLETE

> ✅ **Built** — indexes added in Flyway migrations V3–V5.

```sql
-- V3 (expenses)
CREATE INDEX idx_expenses_user_id      ON expenses(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_expenses_category_id  ON expenses(category_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_expenses_created_at   ON expenses(created_at);

-- V4 (budgets)
CREATE INDEX idx_budgets_user_id       ON budgets(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_budgets_is_active     ON budgets(is_active);

-- V5 (recurring_expenses)
CREATE INDEX idx_recurring_user_id       ON recurring_expenses(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_recurring_next_due_date ON recurring_expenses(next_due_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_recurring_is_active     ON recurring_expenses(is_active);
```

## 5. Reporting & Analytics Improvements

Your current reports are basic aggregates. Real value comes from trend analysis and comparative data.

### 5.1 Report Types — Status

| Report | Endpoint | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Summary** | `GET /api/reports/summary` | ✅ Built |
| **Category-Wise** | `GET /api/reports/category-wise` | ✅ Built |
| **Date-Wise** | `GET /api/reports/date-wise` | ✅ Built |
| **Custom (multi-filter)** | `POST /api/reports/custom` | ✅ Built |
| **Month-over-Month Trends** | `GET /api/reports/trends?months=6` | ✅ Built |
| **Budget vs Actual** | `GET /api/reports/budget-performance` | ✅ Built |
| **Spending Insights** | `GET /api/v1/reports/insights` | ✅ Built |
| **Top Expenses** | `GET /api/v1/reports/top-expenses?limit=10&categoryId=` | ✅ Built |
| **Export to CSV** | `GET /api/v1/reports/export?format=csv` | ✅ Built |
| **Export to PDF** | `GET /api/v1/reports/export?format=pdf` | ✅ Built |

**Monthly Trend (`GET /api/reports/trends?months=6`)**

- Returns one entry per calendar month for the last N months (default 6, max 24)
- Months with zero spending are included with `totalAmount: 0`
- Each month has a `categoryBreakdown` list with category amounts and percentages
- Backed by two native PostgreSQL queries using `EXTRACT(YEAR/MONTH FROM created_at)`

**Budget Performance (`GET /api/reports/budget-performance`)**

- Returns all active budgets with real-time spent/remaining data
- `status` field: `ON_TRACK` | `NEAR_LIMIT` | `EXCEEDED`
- Delegates spending computation to `BudgetService.getBudgetStatus()` to avoid duplication
- Works for both category-scoped and overall (null category) budgets

**Spending Insights (`GET /api/v1/reports/insights`)**

Aggregates all of a user's expenses in-memory to produce a single insight snapshot:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `totalThisMonth` | Sum of expenses from 1st of current month to now |
| `totalLastMonth` | Sum of expenses in the previous calendar month |
| `monthOverMonthChange` | `totalThisMonth - totalLastMonth` (positive = up, negative = down) |
| `spendingVelocity` | `INCREASING` / `DECREASING` / `STABLE` (threshold: ±0.01) |
| `averageDailySpendLast30Days` | Total spend in last 30 days ÷ 30 |
| `highestSpendDay` | `LocalDate` of the single day with most spend in last 30 days |
| `highestSpendDayAmount` | Total amount on that day |
| `biggestExpense` | Full `ExpenseResponse` of the largest single expense ever |
| `mostUsedCategory` | Category name used most often (by count, all-time) |
| `mostUsedCategoryCount` | How many times that category appears |

**Top Expenses (`GET /api/v1/reports/top-expenses?limit=10&categoryId=`)**

- Returns expenses sorted by `amount DESC`
- `limit` capped between 1 and 100 (default: 10)
- Optional `categoryId` query param narrows to one category
- Returns `List<ExpenseResponse>` including tags

### 5.2 Export to CSV / PDF — ✅ COMPLETE

> ✅ **Built** — `ExportService` with `exportCsv()` and `exportPdf()`. `ReportController` exposes `GET /api/reports/export?format=csv|pdf`. Both log `REPORT_EXPORTED` to the audit log.

**Endpoint: `GET /api/reports/export?format=csv|pdf`**

| format | Content-Type | Filename | Library |
|---|---|---|---|
| `csv` (default) | `text/csv` | `expenses.csv` | Apache Commons CSV 1.12.0 |
| `pdf` | `application/pdf` | `expenses.pdf` | OpenPDF 1.3.30 (`com.lowagie.text.*`) |

- Requires `SUPER_ADMIN` role (inherits from `@IsSuperAdmin` on `ReportController`)
- Expenses sorted by `createdAt DESC`
- PDF includes styled table: indigo header row, alternating row shading, 6 columns
- Both formats annotated `@Transactional(readOnly = true)` — keeps Hibernate session open for lazy-loaded `category`
- `AuditAction.REPORT_EXPORTED` logged with format, count, and timestamp

### 5.3 Add Redis Caching — ⬜ NOT YET BUILT

Reports that aggregate months of data should not hit the DB on every request.

- Add `spring-boot-starter-data-redis` to Gradle
- Annotate heavy service methods with `@Cacheable("monthly-summary")`
- On new expense creation: `@CacheEvict("monthly-summary")` to invalidate stale cache
- Summary reports cached for 5 minutes, dashboard for 1 minute

---

## 6. API Design Improvements

### 6.1 API Versioning — ✅ COMPLETE

> ✅ **Built** — All 10 controllers updated to `/api/v1/` prefix. Postman collection updated (52 URL occurrences). SecurityConfig `permitAll` paths updated. Integration tests updated. `DataInitializer` `@Order(1)/(2)` added to fix `CommandLineRunner` race condition surfaced during re-test.

**Updated controllers:**

| Controller | Old prefix | New prefix |
|---|---|---|
| `AuthController` | `/api/auth` | `/api/v1/auth` |
| `ExpenseController` | `/api/expenses` | `/api/v1/expenses` |
| `BudgetController` | `/api/budgets` | `/api/v1/budgets` |
| `ReportController` | `/api/reports` | `/api/v1/reports` |
| `NotificationController` | `/api/notifications` | `/api/v1/notifications` |
| `RecurringExpenseController` | `/api/recurring-expenses` | `/api/v1/recurring-expenses` |
| `DashboardController` | `/api/dashboard` | `/api/v1/dashboard` |
| `UserCategoryController` | `/api/categories` | `/api/v1/categories` |
| `AdminCategoryController` | `/api/admin/categories` | `/api/v1/admin/categories` |
| `AuditLogController` | `/api/audit-logs` | `/api/v1/audit-logs` |

When a breaking change is needed in future, add `/api/v2/` controllers — old clients keep using v1.

### 6.2 Swagger / OpenAPI — ✅ COMPLETE

> ✅ **Built** — `springdoc-openapi-starter-webmvc-ui:3.0.0` (Spring Boot 4.0 / Spring 7 compatible). Global JWT bearer auth configured via `@OpenAPIDefinition` + `@SecurityScheme`. Swagger paths added to `SecurityConfig.permitAll()`.

- Interactive docs at `http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui.html`
- OpenAPI JSON at `http://localhost:8081/v3/api-docs`
- Click **Authorize** in Swagger UI → enter `Bearer <your-token>` → all endpoints callable
- Config class: `config/OpenApiConfig.kt`

### 6.3 Better Error Response Format — ✅ COMPLETE

> ✅ **Built** — `enums/ErrorCode.kt` enum + `exceptions/ErrorResponse.kt` DTO. All handlers in `GlobalExceptionHandler` now return `ErrorResponse` with a machine-readable `code`, `path` (injected via `HttpServletRequest`), `timestamp`, and optional `details` for validation field errors.

**Error codes defined in `ErrorCode` enum:**

| Category | Codes |
|---|---|
| Not Found | `RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND`, `USER_NOT_FOUND`, `TAG_NOT_FOUND` |
| Validation | `VALIDATION_FAILED`, `BAD_REQUEST` |
| Conflict | `CONFLICT`, `EMAIL_ALREADY_EXISTS`, `TAG_ALREADY_EXISTS` |
| Auth | `INVALID_CREDENTIALS`, `ACCOUNT_DEACTIVATED`, `AUTHENTICATION_FAILED`, `UNAUTHORIZED` |
| JWT | `TOKEN_EXPIRED`, `TOKEN_INVALID`, `TOKEN_SIGNATURE_INVALID` |
| Server | `INTERNAL_ERROR` |

**Error response shape:**

```json
{
  "status": false,
  "code": "RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND",
  "message": "Expense not found",
  "timestamp": "2026-03-15T10:30:00",
  "path": "/api/v1/expenses/42",
  "details": null
}
```

Validation errors populate `details` with a map of `{ fieldName: "error message" }`.

**Files:**
- `enums/ErrorCode.kt` — all machine-readable codes
- `exceptions/ErrorResponse.kt` — response DTO (status, code, message, timestamp, path, details)
- `exceptions/GlobalExceptionHandler.kt` — all 9 handlers updated; `ApiResponse<Nothing>` fully replaced

---

## 7. Additional Features Worth Adding

### 7.1 Multi-Currency Support — ✅ COMPLETE

> ✅ **Built** — Per-expense currency field, per-user base currency preference, `exchange_rates` table, daily auto-sync from `open.er-api.com` (free, no API key), USD-pivot cross-rate conversion, manual sync endpoint, and a convert helper endpoint.

**Database Migrations**

| Migration | Change |
|---|---|
| `V10__add_currency_to_expenses.sql` | Adds `currency VARCHAR(3) DEFAULT 'INR'` and `amount_in_base DOUBLE` to `expenses`. Backfills existing rows: `amount_in_base = amount`. |
| `V11__add_base_currency_to_users.sql` | Adds `base_currency VARCHAR(3) DEFAULT 'INR'` to `users`. |
| `V12__create_exchange_rates.sql` | Creates `exchange_rates(id, base_currency, target_currency, rate, fetched_at)` with UNIQUE constraint on the pair. Indexed on base, target, and pair. |

**How conversion works (USD-pivot)**

All rates are stored relative to USD:
```
base_currency = "USD", target_currency = "INR", rate = 83.5
→ 1 USD = 83.5 INR
```

Cross-rate for any A → B conversion:
```
convertedAmount = amount × ( rateUSD→B / rateUSD→A )
```

When an expense is created/updated, `amountInBase` is computed automatically:
```
1. Fetch user's baseCurrency (e.g. "INR")
2. Look up rate(USD→expense.currency) and rate(USD→user.baseCurrency)
3. amountInBase = amount × (rateUSD→baseCurrency / rateUSD→expenseCurrency)
4. Store both amount (original) and amountInBase (converted)
```

Same-currency expenses: `amountInBase = amount` (no rate lookup needed).

**Exchange rate sync**

- Source: `https://open.er-api.com/v6/latest/USD` — free, no API key required
- `@Scheduled(cron = "0 0 1 * * *")` — runs at 01:00 AM daily
- On sync: fetches all ~160 currencies, upserts each rate in DB
- `POST /api/v1/exchange-rates/sync` — manual trigger (requires ADMIN role)
- Sync failure never throws — logged and swallowed to prevent startup failure

**Files added / modified:**

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `entity/ExchangeRate.kt` | New entity: `baseCurrency`, `targetCurrency`, `rate`, `fetchedAt` |
| `repository/ExchangeRateRepository.kt` | `findByBaseCurrency`, `findByBaseCurrencyAndTargetCurrency` |
| `service/ExchangeRateService.kt` | `convert()`, `syncRates()`, `@Scheduled` daily sync, `RestClient` HTTP call |
| `controllers/ExchangeRateController.kt` | 3 endpoints at `/api/v1/exchange-rates` |
| `entity/User.kt` | Added `baseCurrency: String = "INR"` |
| `entity/Expense.kt` | Added `currency: String = "INR"`, `amountInBase: Double` |
| `dto/request/ExpenseRequest.kt` | Added `currency: String = "INR"` |
| `dto/request/UpdateBaseCurrencyRequest.kt` | New: `baseCurrency` with `@Size(3)` + `@Pattern([A-Z]{3})` |
| `dto/response/ExpenseResponse.kt` | Added `currency`, `amountInBase` |

### 7.2 Receipt Attachments — ⬜ NOT YET BUILT

- Add `receipts` table: `id`, `expense_id`, `file_path`, `file_name`, `uploaded_at`
- Store files in MinIO (self-hosted S3-compatible) or AWS S3
- `POST /api/expenses/{id}/receipts` — multipart file upload
- `GET /api/expenses/{id}/receipts` — list attachments with pre-signed URLs
- Max file size: 5MB, allowed types: jpg, png, pdf

### 7.3 Tags / Labels — ✅ COMPLETE

> ✅ **Built** — Many-to-many relationship between expenses and tags. Tags are per-user. V9 migration creates the `tags` and `expense_tags` tables. Full CRUD at `/api/v1/tags`. Expenses can be filtered by `tagIds`. Audit logged.

**DB Tables (V9__create_tags.sql)**

```sql
TABLE: tags
  id         BIGSERIAL PK
  name       VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
  color      VARCHAR(7) DEFAULT '#6366f1'
  user_id    BIGINT NOT NULL
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
  UNIQUE (name, user_id)

TABLE: expense_tags
  expense_id BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES expenses(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
  tag_id     BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES tags(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
  PRIMARY KEY (expense_id, tag_id)

INDEXES:
  idx_tags_user_id              ON tags(user_id)
  idx_expense_tags_expense_id   ON expense_tags(expense_id)
  idx_expense_tags_tag_id       ON expense_tags(tag_id)
```

**Files added / modified:**

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `entity/Tag.kt` | New entity — `@Entity`, `@Table(uniqueConstraints = [name, user_id])` |
| `repository/TagRepository.kt` | `findByUserId`, `findByIdAndUserId`, `existsByNameAndUserId` |
| `service/TagService.kt` | Create/get/update/delete with `ConflictException` on duplicate name; full audit logging |
| `controllers/TagController.kt` | `@IsAuthenticated`, 5 endpoints at `/api/v1/tags` |
| `entity/Expense.kt` | Added `@ManyToMany(EAGER)` `tags` field with `@JoinTable(expense_tags)` |
| `dto/request/ExpenseRequest.kt` | Added `tagIds: List<Long> = emptyList()` |
| `dto/request/ExpenseFilterRequest.kt` | Added `tagIds: List<Long>? = null` |
| `dto/response/ExpenseResponse.kt` | Added `tags: List<TagResponse>` field; `fromEntity()` maps tags |
| `specifications/ExpenseSpecifications.kt` | Added `filterByTagIds()` using INNER JOIN; wired into `buildFilterSpecification` |
| `service/ExpenseService.kt` | Injected `TagRepository`; `createExpense`/`updateExpense` resolve tags by ownership |
| `enums/AuditAction.kt` | Added `TAG_CREATED`, `TAG_UPDATED`, `TAG_DELETED` |
| `dto/response/TagResponse.kt` | New DTO: id, name, color, userId, createdAt |
| `dto/request/TagRequest.kt` | New request: `@NotBlank` name + `@Pattern` hex color |

**Completed endpoints:**

| Endpoint | Auth | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /api/v1/tags` | Authenticated | Create a new tag (conflict on duplicate name) |
| `GET /api/v1/tags` | Authenticated | List all tags for the current user |
| `GET /api/v1/tags/{id}` | Authenticated | Get one tag (ownership enforced) |
| `PUT /api/v1/tags/{id}` | Authenticated | Update name/color (conflict check on rename) |
| `DELETE /api/v1/tags/{id}` | Authenticated | Delete tag (cascades to expense_tags) |

To filter expenses by tags: `POST /api/v1/expenses/filter` with `tagIds: [1, 3]` in the request body.

### 7.4 OAuth2 / Social Login — ⬜ NOT YET BUILT

- Add `spring-boot-starter-oauth2-client` to Gradle
- Support Google and GitHub login
- On OAuth2 success: create user if not exists, assign USER role, return JWT
- Users authenticated via OAuth2 have no password — handle in registration checks

---

## 8. Testing — ✅ COMPLETE

> ✅ **Built** — 45 tests across unit, integration, and security layers. All passing. H2 in-memory DB for tests; Flyway disabled; `EnvConfig` post-processor skipped via `test` profile guard.

### 8.1 Test Infrastructure

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `src/test/resources/application-test.properties` | H2 datasource, Flyway disabled, `create-drop` DDL, test JWT secret |
| `config/EnvConfig.kt` | Patched to skip env-var enforcement when `test` profile is active |

**Dependencies added to `build.gradle.kts`:**
```kotlin
testImplementation("org.mockito.kotlin:mockito-kotlin:5.4.0")
testImplementation("org.mockito:mockito-core:5.14.2")
testRuntimeOnly("com.h2database:h2")
testImplementation("org.springframework.security:spring-security-test")
```

### 8.2 Test Coverage

| Test Class | Tests | What It Covers |
|---|---|---|
| `ExpenseServiceTest` | 9 | create (success + budget block), get (found/not found/wrong user), update (success/not found), delete (success/wrong user) |
| `BudgetServiceTest` | 6 | create overall budget, list with spent, soft-delete, delete not found throws, no-block when no budgets, block when over limit |
| `NotificationServiceTest` | 7 | send (success + swallows errors), markAsRead (success + wrong user throws), delete (success + not found throws), unread count |
| `AuthServiceTest` | 6 | register (success + duplicate email throws), login (success + wrong password + not found + deactivated account) |
| `SecurityIntegrationTest` | 10 | Swagger UI / OpenAPI accessible without token; login/register reachable; 6 protected endpoints return 401 |
| `ExpenseOwnershipIntegrationTest` | 6 | User A can read/update/delete own expense; User B returns null/false for each operation — no cross-user leakage |

### 8.3 Key Test Cases Covered

- ✅ User A cannot GET, PUT, DELETE User B's expense — returns `null`/`false` (controller maps to 404)
- ✅ Creating expense over budget throws `BadRequestException` — expense never saved
- ✅ Login with wrong password returns 401 via `GlobalExceptionHandler`
- ✅ Deactivated account blocks login
- ✅ Duplicate email registration throws `IllegalArgumentException`
- ✅ Swagger UI at `/swagger-ui/index.html` returns 200 without token
- ✅ All protected endpoints return 401 without token

## 9. DevOps & Production Readiness

### 9.1 Observability Stack

| Component | Status | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| **Health Checks** | ✅ Done | Spring Actuator: `/actuator/health` and `/actuator/info` exposed; `show-details=when-authorized` |
| **Metrics** | ⬜ Not built | Micrometer + Prometheus: expose `/actuator/prometheus` endpoint |
| **Dashboards** | ⬜ Not built | Grafana: connect to Prometheus, create expense creation rate, error rate panels |
| **Structured Logs** | ⬜ Not built | Logback: output JSON logs with userId, requestId, duration per request |
| **Log Aggregation** | ⬜ Not built | Ship logs to ELK stack (Elasticsearch + Logstash + Kibana) |

### 9.2 Secrets Management

> ⚠️ **Current Problem**
>
> JWT_SECRET and DB credentials live in a `.env` file. In production, this file can be accidentally committed, leaked, or accessed by the wrong person.

- AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault for production secrets
- GitHub Actions Secrets for CI/CD pipeline credentials
- Never commit `.env` to version control — add to `.gitignore`
- Rotate `JWT_SECRET` periodically — have a migration plan for active tokens

### 9.3 CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

```
Recommended pipeline: push to main →
  1. Run unit tests (fail fast)
  2. Run integration tests with Testcontainers
  3. Build Docker image
  4. Push to container registry (GHCR or ECR)
  5. Deploy to staging (auto)
  6. Deploy to production (manual approval)
```
